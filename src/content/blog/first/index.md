## Welcome to my Software Architecture Blog!

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work with a wide range of technologies across various domains and roles. The journey has been an evolution, from hands-on coding to strategic decision-making in architecture.

I began my career as what would now be called a full-stack developer, although back then, the term didn’t exist. We were often called "webmasters," responsible for everything from design and HTML/CSS/JS to server-side logic and databases, even handling some sysadmin tasks to ensure everything worked together seamlessly.

From there, I transitioned into a role as a web designer, a position that was essentially created for me. My focus was on the design and front-end aspects, shaping the user interface and experience for websites.

Then came the entrepreneurial phase—before I even knew what a "startup" was. I took on every role: developer, designer, marketer, and salesperson. It was a whirlwind of learning, some of it easy, some of it challenging, but every lesson was valuable. I’m grateful I kept pushing through, continuing to learn and grow.

However, my startup faced scalability issues, bugs, and outages, which ultimately led to its failure. This setback motivated me to dive deeper into how to build systems properly. I returned to the corporate world, working for a software company as a developer, and over the years, I gained experience in solving complex problems with a variety of technologies.

Now, more than a decade later, I’ve transitioned into the role of a software architect. During this time, I’ve accumulated a wealth of knowledge, tools, techniques, and resources that have been instrumental in my growth. I’m excited to share these insights with you here.

Through this blog, I hope to offer guidance and insights, whether you’re starting your journey or looking to expand your knowledge in software architecture. My goal is to post something new every week, sharing lessons learned and practical resources to help you along the way.

Let’s learn together!

See you in the next post!
